This is an example that includes 150 samples, with 30 samples randomly selected from each of the five marine regions. Here, we provide the code and results for a Random Forest model, which includes the processes of feature selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation. This is intended to help illustrate some of the machine learning concepts discussed in the manuscript.
